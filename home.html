            <li >GET ORGANISED</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Taking the time to get organised will set you up well and help you achieve your learning goals.
                Top study tips:</li>
                <li>Invest in a diary, and use it to keep track of current assignment deadlines.</li>
                <li>Bring all the material and devices you need to class, so you can participate.</li>
                <li> You may find it helpful to pack your bag the night before, so you’re ready to go first thing in the morning.</li>

            <li> DON’T SKIP CLASS!</li>
            <ul>
               
                <li>Skipping class can be detrimental to your learning and achieving your study goals. It leaves gaping holes in your notes – and in your subject knowledge.
                    VU’s Block Model is designed to give you more time to devote to work, your social life and other commitments.</li>
                    <li>Rather than juggling four subjects at once, you’ll concentrate on one unit (subject) over a four-week ‘block’ period. 
                    You’ll attend three-hour workshop-style classes, three times a week. </li>
                    <li>The rest of your time can be used to study, work, see friends – whatever is most important to you.
                    Remember to practise active listening by focusing on what your teachers are saying in class and taking notes as needed.</li>

            <li>TAKE NOTES</li>
            <ul>
                <li>To keep your brain engaged during class, take notes, which you can refer to later, as you refine your study techniques.
                </li>
                <li>Notes can help store information in your long-term memory, right there in class. 
                    These notes will be important for reviewing when you’re completing assessments and assignments.

                </li>
                <li>You might find it handy to condense your notes after class, so they’re clear and easy to read.
                     Underline or highlight key points.
                     If anything doesn’t make sense, you can seek clarification from your teacher.</li>

            <li>Your teacher is, in a way, a resource who is there to be used!</li>
            <li>The VU Block Model allows you to focus on one subject at a time. 
                Learning in a work-shop style class, you get the opportunity to know your teacher.</li>
                <li>You can take advantage of this interactive learning environment by asking questions during or after class, where you can get fast feedback.</li>

                    <li> One of the most effective ways of studying is to space out your learning sessions.</li>
                    <li> If you break up your study load over several days, you’ll retain information far more readily than if you crammed in one long session.</li>
                    <li> This can help deeply ingrain information, allowing you to retain it for the long term.</li>
